## How to install

### Requirements

First, you will need to have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) installed, a free spotify account, and an instagram account.

Then go to https://developer.spotify.com/ and login with your spotify account.
Enter the dashboard using the menu in the right top corner.

You will get to this screen :

- App Description : **Instagram for Spotify**
- Website : **None**
- Redirect URL : http://localhost/
